# Work Day Scheduler

Link to working application: https://brianpraseuth.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler-APIs/

Created a simple work day scheduler in which the day was divided in to hour long blocks. The user can type in the text box of each hour and save using the save button. User input will be stored to local storage, so the information will still be present if page is refreshed.
